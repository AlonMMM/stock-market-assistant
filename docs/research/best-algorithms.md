# Best algorithms log

Every time a backtested version beats the current champion, it is added here, and the user gets a big signal
(see the rule in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)). Losers and ties are not logged here; they go in the research log
(`docs/tasks/research-indi-backtest.md`) and the report doc.

## What counts as better

A version beats the champion only when **all** hold, on the same period (Feb 2024 – Oct 2026), the same trade model
(fills at the bar middle ± 2%) and the same sizing (1% of the current account from $100,000):

1. **Fair list:** it ends higher than the champion on the stocks Indi traded the year before (no look-ahead), or
   ends about the same with a clearly smaller worst drop.
2. **Every year positive** on the fair list (2024, 2025, 2026).
3. **Unseen stocks:** on the 151 stocks outside his 40 it is no worse than the champion. A filter that helps only
   on his 40 stocks does not count; the sector filter failed exactly this way.
4. It was not tuned on the result it is judged by. If its thresholds were picked from these numbers, say so.

## Champion

| Since      | Version                                                                                                                                                                                         | Fair list: end / worst drop / years           | 151 unseen: end / worst drop |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2026-10-22 | **News filter + t ≥ 1.8**: the C signal with t ≥ 1.8 (not 2.0) and day volume ≥ 1.5×, no entry on earnings reaction days or with pre-market volume ≥ 4×, delta 0.15, your stop + overnight hold | $585,592 / 11% / +2,762 +2,039 +2,699 a trade | $123,028 / 11%               |

- At 2% a trade: $2,444,629 / 21% (news filter at t ≥ 2: $688,039 / 30%).
- It holds at delta 0.10: $808,028 / 13% (t ≥ 2: $503,674 / 15%), unseen $104,830 / 6% (t ≥ 2: $102,663 / 9%).
- Without the 5 best trades a year it is better in 2025 and 2026 (+$39K / -$139K vs -$167K / -$350K).
- Picked from a 4 × 5 grid (t 1.7-2.0 × volume 1.2-1.7). Its neighbour t ≥ 1.9 also beats t ≥ 2 on both lists at both
  deltas ($426,571 / $128,979 at 0.15), so the gain is a band, not one cell. Lower volume cut-offs (1.2-1.3) do more on
  the fair list but worse on the unseen; t ≥ 1.7 falls on the unseen.

The previous champion, the news filter at t ≥ 2: $297,160 / 16%, unseen $121,443 / 11%.

V1 (C signal t ≥ 2 vs SPY × β, day volume ≥ 1.5×, delta 0.15, your stop + overnight hold for winners ≥ +100%) is the
paper bot: $257,698 / 26% on the fair list, $107,869 / 21% on the unseen.

## Tested, not better (V2, 2026-10-21)

- IV filters (own IV rank, low-IV stocks, IV / realized vol): about the same as trading less; fail at 0.10 and unseen.
- Rolling out when the stock nears the strike fast (to delta 0.15 or 0.30): $161K – $206K; it sells the big winners.
- Overnight: no hold after a 5/10-minute premium drop; a 3–5% cap on what goes into the night: all worse or mixed.
- Give-back locks 200 → 50 and 300 → 100, trails 100/50, 200/40, 300/50, the ladder: worse or worse on the unseen.
- End-of-day entries for tomorrow (volume-free strength vs SPY, near the high): lose 2024 and 2025.
- Score and moving-volume entries (t ≥ 3 with 1×, t ≥ 2.5 with 1.2×, t ≥ 1.5 with 2.5×, scores 2.0 / 3.0, moving-volume
  blend, speeding-up boost, 5-minute burst): none better on both lists.
- Selling 25% at +150% and 25% at +250%: $142,572 / 20%. Carried-day trailing stops (25 / 40 / 50%): worse.
- False alarms (the stock or SPY against the bet at the signal): only 3 of 820 trades; filters do not help.
- Scale-in on the t >= 1.8 champion: worse (A $476,299 / 12% vs $585,592 / 11% at 1%; unseen $115,967 vs $123,028).
- Stall exit (after a big spike, no new stock extreme for 30-60 minutes, optionally 40% under the peak or volume fading),
  on t >= 1.8: $135K-$499K vs $585,592; even only for trades under +100% (not going overnight): $265K-$465K. A stall
  often comes before the next leg or the overnight gap.
- Buying back what a 10/20-minute check sold when the stock turns our way within 60 minutes (cross the entry, 0.2% past
  it, or a new day extreme), on t >= 1.8: $507K-$555K vs $585,592, worse on the unseen; the false recoveries cost more
  than the real ones bring.
- 0DTE allowed in the champion: worse (doubles the worst drop; loses 2025 and 2026).
- A separate 0DTE strategy (expiry days only, entries 09:40-12:30 New York, V1 or lower thresholds, with or without a
  breakout; exits checked every minute: option stops, trails, half at +100%, your stop + trail, F4; delta 0.15 / 0.30;
  32 + 6 runs): the best balanced one makes $109,397 / 11% on the fair list over 2.7 years and loses 2025; the 151
  unseen lose with every version. F4 + breakout ($152,567) rests on a few 2024 trades with 12% winners.
- Wait 5 minutes, then check every minute for the half (F1-F4): F1 / F3 (stock against) help the unseen ($133,098 /
  8%) but cost about 20% on the fair list; F4 (option -15%) ends higher at the same size ($315,345 / 19%) but loses at
  equal worst drop (F4 at 1.75% $630,783 / 31% vs the champion at 2% $688,039 / 30%) and on the unseen.
- Selling half at the first minute the stock is against the entry (instead of the +10 / +20 checks): $183K – $207K.
- Overnight caps: 5% and 10% cost a lot; 15–20% cost nothing at 0.15 but do not cut the worst drop (kept as a safety idea).

## Candidates

- 0DTE on the user's favorites list (50 stocks, first hour, news filter): 21 of 96 results positive every year. Best
  cluster: a new day-high breakout (t >= 2, volume >= 1.5x), the -40% stop only, delta 0.20-0.30: about $158-162K / 8-10%
  at 1% over 2.7 years ($112-122K in 2026 alone), only 15-16% winners. The list is today's, so it carries hindsight.

- Sector-relaxed thresholds (t 1.5 / volume 1.2, or 1.7 / 1.3, when the sector ETF is 0.3% our way): worse or worse on
  the unseen ($264,568 / $380,820 / $297,768 fair; $119,808 / $103,173 / $122,185 unseen, with bigger drops).
- A $0.10 minimum price: worse at 0.15; better-looking at 0.10 but the backtest's 2% cost is far too low for $0.10 options.
- 0DTE in Indi's range (delta 0.20 / 0.25 / 0.30, first hour or 14:30-15:30 New York, SPY filter at ±0.5%; 352 strategy
  results): the SPY filter helps a little (median fair end $98,672 vs $96,028; 5 of the 6 steady ones use it); the late
  window does not work for us (median $93,720, none steady); 0.30 is the only delta with steady results; Fridays make
  the money for us (Mon / Wed lose). Steadiest: yesterday's-level breakout (E6, volume >= 1.5x), first hour, thirds (X7),
  delta 0.30, SPY filter: 34 fair-list trades in 2.7 years, 68% winners, $110K / 1% at 1% and $159K / 5% at 5%; unseen
  $105K / $126K. Too few trades to trust yet.
- Overnight cap at 8% of the account: free at 1% a trade (+4%; worst night -8.8% -> -4.2%), -25% at 2% (worst night
  -17.6% -> -5.4%), -60% to -71% at 4-5%; the worst drop hardly changes.

- 0DTE, the big run (360 strategies: 6 breakout entries x 10 exits x delta 0.15 / 0.30 / 0.45 x fill on the breakout
  bar or the next open): the median strategy loses; only 2 of 360 are positive every year on both lists. The one
  cluster that holds across deltas and fill timing: a breakout of yesterday's high/low (E5: t >= 1, volume >= 1.2x),
  a third sold at +50%, a third at +100%, the rest trailing 30% (X7), delta 0.45: 112 fair-list trades, 55% winners,
  $110,987 – $111,220 / 2% at 1% and $163K / 10% at 5%; unseen $102K / 3–4% at 1%, $108–110K at 5% (2026 slightly
  negative there). Small but steady; far below the champion ($297,160 at 1%).

- Scale in, D (half at the signal, the other half at minute 5 only if the stock is our way): at the same nominal size
  it ends lower ($267,990 / 14% vs $297,160 / 16% at 1%), but at equal worst drop it beats the champion on both lists
  (fair at 2%: $597,796 / 25% vs the champion at 1.6%, $504,560 / 25%; unseen at 2%: $138,725 / 14% vs $121,443 / 11%
  at 1% and $129,966 / 17% at 1.5%), and it is positive every year on the unseen (+370 / +948 / +1,280).
- Scale in, A (add at the first minute 1-5 the stock is our way): fair list better ($306,316 / 14%; $741,653 / 27% at
  2%), unseen worse ($109,776 / 9%).
- Buying on the signal bar's close instead of the next bar's middle: $516,519 / 13% (champion $297,160 / 16%); an
  optimistic upper bound (a bar's close is its last trade, not the ask). The live bot should be faster.

- Entry score ≥ 2.5 (t/2 + volume/1.5, floors t 1.5, volume 1×): fair list $490,168 / 11%, but unseen $82,370 / 30%.
- Sell everything at the morning gap (not half): about 27% more at the same worst drop on the fair list at 0.15, but
  worse at 0.10 and on the unseen.
